## 🔁 MindMirror MK2 (Future Improvements)

Once core adoption is proven, the following will be implemented:

### 🧾 Dashboard

* **Login via OAuth (Google)**

* **Memory Count:** See how many memories you've stored
* **Memory Browser (Read-Only)**
* **Filter by tag:** (preference, goal, habit, routine, etc.)

	Edit/delete memory, conflict resolution in front end dashboard (MK2)
		- not too needed cause ai model can do that for us, no need for front end to do the same for now

### 🔥 Conflict Resolution (Visual UI)

* Detect when you’ve stored contradictory preferences
* Show conflicts with timestamps
* Let user resolve visually — “Keep A, delete B”

### 📊 Usage Analytics

* See what Claude is remembering most
* Track how memory is evolving over time
* Memory export or backup (critical for user trust)

### 💳 Premium Tier (Billing)

* Stripe integration
* Raise cap from 25 → 5000+ memories
* Unlock advanced dashboard and analytics
* Priority API access for custom integrations



* Privacy Policy as separate page if going public or getting legal
* Optional testimonials if you’re targeting bigger orgs later
