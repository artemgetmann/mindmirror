## 🧠 About MindMirror

**Why I Built This**

As someone building advanced AI tools, I hit the same wall again and again: no memory. Every new conversation with an assistant was a reset. I wanted an AI that could learn over time — store context, remember my tools, habits, routines — and *use* that memory intelligently.

But building memory for LLMs is a pain. Claude has memory, ChatGPT has memory — but their APIs don’t. You’re forced to build it yourself. I needed a simple plug-and-play memory layer that could work across tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and even my own AI systems. So I built one.

**MindMirror** is the missing memory layer for AI builders and power users. A fast, Claude-compatible memory server that gives your assistant real memory — searchable, persistent, and taggable — without complex setup.

This project started as a personal need. But as I shared it, I realized many others felt the same. Memory unlocks real AI utility. Preferences, goals, context — they shouldn’t disappear when the session ends.

I believe powerful, persistent memory is a key step toward real AGI. And **MindMirror** is my way of pushing that forward. If you want to support this vision — building sharper AI, building AGI, building better tools — then join the waitlist and let’s scale it.
