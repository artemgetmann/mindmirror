## 🧠 About MindMirror

**Why I Built This**

As someone building advanced AI tools, I hit the same wall again and again: no memory. Every new conversation with an assistant was a reset. I wanted an AI that could learn over time — store context, remember my tools, habits, routines — and *use* that memory intelligently.

But building memory for LLMs is a pain. Claude has memory, ChatGPT has memory — but their APIs don’t. You’re forced to build it yourself. I needed a simple plug-and-play memory layer that could work across tools like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and even my own AI systems. So I built one.

**MindMirror** is the missing memory layer for AI builders and power users. A fast, Claude-compatible memory server that gives your assistant real memory — searchable, persistent, and taggable — without complex setup.

This project started as a personal need. But as I shared it, I realized many others felt the same. Memory unlocks real AI utility. Preferences, goals, context — they shouldn’t disappear when the session ends.

I believe powerful, persistent memory is a key step toward real AGI. And **MindMirror** is my way of pushing that forward. If you want to support this vision — building sharper AI, building AGI, building better tools — then join the waitlist and let’s scale it.


Let me know if you want to fund this journey.
Or just want your AI to finally remember you.

Either way, MindMirror is now live.
